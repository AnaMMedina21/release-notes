    "markdown": "`--log-flush-frequency` had no effect in several commands or was missing. Help and warning texts were not always using the right format for a command (`add_dir_header` instead of `add-dir-header`). Fixing this included cleaning up flag handling in component-base/logs: that package no longer adds flags to the global flag sets. Commands which want the klog and --log-flush-frequency flags must explicitly call logs.AddFlags; the new cli.Run does that for commands. That helper function also covers flag normalization and printing of usage and errors in a consistent way (print usage text first if parsing failed, then the error).
